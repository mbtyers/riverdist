# 'riverdist' 0.17.1 (Nov 07, 2024)

* Patch to fix waldo dependency

# 'riverdist' 0.17.0 (Oct 14, 2024)

### Added capabilities:

* `densityanomaly()` added, to highlight differences between kernel density for individual surveys and mean kernel density across all surveys

* `segvert2xy()` added, to extract XY coordinates from vectors of segment and vertex

* `xy2segvert()` and `ptshp2segvert()` now include columns `snap_x` and `snap_y`, corresponding to the XY coordinates of each point, "snapped" to the river network.

### Minor bug fix: 

* fixed scale bar in `plot.riverdensity()`

# 'riverdist' 0.16.3 (Jan 05, 2024)

# 'riverdist' 0.16.2 (Dec 05, 2023)

* Addressing forthcoming changes to `sf` package.

# 'riverdist' 0.16.1 (Aug 21, 2023)

* Fixed a bug in `plot.homerange()`

# 'riverdist' 0.16.0 (July 31, 2023)

* Transition to remove dependency on `sp` and `rgdal` packages, and transition to newer-generation `sf` package.

# 'riverdist' 0.15.5 (December 31, 2021)

* Fixed testing glitch for compatibility with new R version

# 'riverdist' 0.15.4 (September 8, 2021)

* Updated maintainer email address

# 'riverdist' 0.15.3 (July 1, 2020)

* Minor bug fix

# 'riverdist' 0.15.2 and 0.15.1 (June 2, 2020)

* Minor update for compatibility with new PROJ

# 'riverdist' 0.15.0 (Jul 18, 2017)

### Added capabilities

* `cleanup_verts()` added, for editing of the vertices of individual segments

* `routelist()` now returns all complete routes (and faster)

* `splitsegments()` can now split a subset of segments at specified locations

* `connectsegs()` can now connect vectors of segments

* `cleanup()` improved

* Better algorithm used for `checkbraidedTF()` - MUCH faster, and no longer hangs in a complex test case

* `detectroute(..., algorithm="Dijkstra")` speeded up substantially

* `topologydots()` speeded up

### Bug fixes

* Better algorithm used for `checkbraidedTF()` - MUCH faster, and no longer hangs in a complex test case

* `plot.rivernetwork()` no longer errors when only one segment is visible in plotting window

# 'riverdist' 0.14.0 (Mar 31, 2017) - development version 0.13.1.9001

### Added capabilities

* `homerange()` now creates homerange-class objects

* Added `plot.homerange()`, `homerangeoverlap()` and `plothomerangeoverlap()`, which all accept homerange-class objects

* Optimization in `homerange()`: speeded up by a factor of 10ish, depending on the dataset

* Line color in an empty plot with `plot.rivernetwork()` now settable with argument `linecol=`

### Bug fixes

* `mouthdist()` accepts vectors of segment and vertex coordinates

* `segmentnum=` and `empty=` in `plot.rivernetwork()` and others re-implemented

# 'riverdist' 0.13.1 (Feb 3, 2017)

### Added capabilities

* Including a scale bar in `plot.riverdensity()` with `scalebar=T`

### Bug fixes

* Producing plots in `plot.riverdensity()` in the correct order, if `survey` is a factor variable with levels in a different order than alphabetic

# 'riverdist' 0.13.0 (Dec 21, 2016)

### Added capabilities

* Making an empty river plot (using `empty=TRUE`)

* Jittering `riverpoints()` using `jitter` argument

* Optimization in `riverpoints()` and `xy2segvert()`: both were speeded up by a factor of 10

* Optimization in `plot.rivernetwork()`: speeded up by a factor of 2

### Bug fixes

* Allowing vectors of `pch` and `col` in `riverpoints()`

# 'riverdist' 0.12.1 and 0.12.2 (Aug 11, 2016)

### Bug fixes

* A bug in the braiding check algorithm used in `cleanup()` was identified and fixed.

# 'riverdist' 0.12.0 (July 5, 2016)

### Major changes

* Distance calculation is much, much faster since the last CRAN release (0.11.0).  Both the Dijkstra and segroutes algorithm run in about one hundredth the time that they previously did.

* Additional components were added to the rivernetwork class, to aid in distance calculation speed.  `$cumuldist` is a list of vectors of cumulative distances associated with each line segment, and `$distlookup` is a list of lookup tables.  Distance calculation is now done using these components, which will need to be calculated for any saved river network objects. 

### Bug fixes

* Bugs in the `dissolve()` and `homerange()` functions and segroutes algorithm were identified and fixed.

* New connection types were added, to handle special cases in braided networks.

* Error handling in `line2network()` was improved, and more complex networks can now be read in a manageable amount of time.
